# Fast-git

All of the following is translated in Google translator!

This git is a plugin for the sublime text program. Its advantage is that you don't need to install github cli and git as they come with a set. 
Everything is implemented using batch commands sent by sublime text. But I can admit that because of this, the weight is significantly large.

## Basic functional (context menu)
1. Set token → «input token»
2. Set remote url → «choise open folder» → «input url»
3. Create repository → «choise open folder»
4. Update repository → «choise open folder»
5. Clone repository → «choise open folder»

## Key bindings 
Also added keyboard shortcuts for quick pushing. "ctrl+<number from 1 to 0 on keyboard>"  
Example:  
Your open folder is the first one in the list, press ctrl+1.  
Or your open folder is second in the list, press ctrl+2. And so on.
