# Fast-git

All of the following is translated in Google translator!

This git is a plugin for the sublime text program. Its advantage is that you don't need to install github cli and git as they come with a set. 
Everything is implemented using batch commands sent by sublime text. But I can admit that because of this, the weight is significantly large.

**Basic functional (context menu)**
1. Set token
2. Set remote url
3. Create repository
4. Update repository
5. Clone repository
